<h1>Biggest challenges in the seed sector of low and middle income countries</h1>

<h2>Market access</h2>
<p>Measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 have reduced market access for seed producers, agro-dealers and farmers, leading to lower demand and supply of quality seeds.</p>

<h2>Price affordability</h2>
<p>The reduced market access has also increased the prices of seeds and other inputs, making them unaffordable for many farmers.</p>

<h2>Quality assurance</h2>
<p>The quality assurance processes for seeds are hampered by lack of infrastructure, capacity, regulation and enforcement. This affects the availability and reliability of quality seeds for farmers.</p>

<h2>Early generation seed production</h2>
<p>The production of early generation seeds (breeder and foundation seeds) is hindered by lack of public investment, research capacity, coordination and incentives. This affects the supply chain of improved varieties and limits their adoption by farmers.</p>

<h2>Agrobiodiversity</h2>
<p>The seed sector is dominated by a few large companies that produce uniform varieties that may not suit the diverse needs and preferences of farmers. This reduces the agrobiodiversity in production systems and erodes local knowledge and practices.</p>

<h2>Climate change</h2>
<p>The seed sector is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change such as droughts, floods, pests and diseases. These affect the seed production, distribution and storage, as well as the performance and resilience of crops.</p>

<h2>Gender equity</h2>
<p>The seed sector often overlooks the different roles, needs and preferences of men and women farmers in relation to seeds. This affects their access to quality seeds, information and services, as well as their participation in decision-making processes.</p>

<h2>Seed security</h2>
<p>The seed sector faces frequent shocks such as conflicts, disasters or pandemics that disrupt its functioning. This affects the seed security of farmers who may lose their seeds or face shortages or delays in accessing them.</p>

<h2>Innovation</h2>
<p>The seed sector lacks innovation in terms of developing new varieties that meet the changing needs and demands of farmers and consumers. This affects the competitiveness and sustainability of the sector.</p>

<h2>Policy environment</h2>
<p>The seed sector operates under complex policy environments that may not be conducive for its development. This affects its governance, regulation, coordination and collaboration among different actors.</p>
